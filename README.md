# pyFlowMeter
Transform pcaps to flow information with several features, includes labeling options.

## About the labeling
I'm being lazy, you must have a file called labels.txt in order to run the code.
This file has the following format:

flowid,label

The flowid is generated by the communityid proposal.

In the folder labelexample, there is a file with the labels corresponding to the [CIC Dos Dataset 2017](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/dos-dataset.html)
You must move the file and rename to labels.txt in order to use. Otherwise, only create an empty file to run the code.
